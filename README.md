Welcome to my Epitech's project repo

You can try 4 projects that I develop during my first year at Epitech, with C language.

- Antman:
A program that compress and uncompress HTML, Image and Text files.
If you want to try:
    - To compile: "make"
    - To compress: "./compress original_file"
    - To uncompress: "./uncompress compress_file"
    - To test the compression ratio: "./script_test.sh original_file", it requires the binary

- 42sh:
A reproduction of tcsh shell : Execute binary, command and builtin, Pipe, Redirection, Alias, Globbing.
If you want to try:
    - To compile: "make"
    - To launch: "./42sh"

Video-Games:
 - Defender:
 A tower defense game, build with CSFML library.
 If you want to try:
    - To compile: "make"
    - To launch: "./my_defender"
    - To see help: "./my_defender -h"

 - Rpg:
 A RPG game (Npc, Quest, Fight, ...), build with CSFML library
 If you want to try:
    - To compile: "make"
    - To launch: "./my_rpg"
    - To see help: "./my_rpg -h"
